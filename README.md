# Thrumming Stone

This tool uses hypergeometric distribution to calculate probablities through turns for Magic: the Gathering. It is especially useful for decks running Thrumming Stone and one or more of the singleton rule breakers (such as Shadowborn Apostles). A valid, non-private Moxfield deck URL is required.
